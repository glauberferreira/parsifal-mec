				{% trans 'The QeeD Platform is a tool designed for researchers to perform systematic literature reviews and meta-analyzes. Geographically distributed researchers can work together in a shared environment, designing the protocol and leading research into the development of research meta-analysis.' %}
			</p>
			<p>
				{% trans 'In addition to providing a way to document the entire process, the tool will help you remember what is important during a systematic literature review. During the planning phase, the QeeD Platform will assist you with objectives, search method definition, search questions, search strings, keywords and synonyms by selecting sources, inclusion and exclusion criteria. It will also provide mechanisms for building a quality assessment checklist and data extraction forms.' %}
			</p>
			<p>
				{% trans 'During the driving phase, you will be able to import bibtex files and select studies, find duplicates among all different sources, perform quality assessment and extract data from documents. Finally, it will be possible to visualize the data generated for both systematic review and meta-analysis.' %}
			</p>

			<h3>{% trans 'What is a meta-analysis??' %}</h3>
			<p>
				{% trans 'A systematic literature review is a secondary study aimed at identifying, analyzing and interpreting all available evidence from primary studies related to a specific research question. As suggested by Kitchenham and Charters, activities to conduct a systematic literature review involve planning, conducting, and reporting the review.'%}
			</p>
			<h3>{% trans 'What is a Systematic Literature Review?' %}</h3>
			<p>{% trans 'A meta-analysis consists of a statistical technique used to integrate and compare results obtained from research conducted independently for a given theme in order to allow a critical and comparative analysis of the considered studies' %}</p>

			<h3>{% trans 'About the development.' %}</h3>
			<p>{% trans 'The QeeD tool was developed by the Center for Excellence in Social Technologies (NEES), a research group linked to the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL). This tool was developed as a modified version of the Parsifal platform (https://parsif.al/), where new features related to the construction of systematic reviews as well as the support to the construction of meta-analyzes were added. The Parsifal tool was contributed by researcher Vitor Freitas (https://vitorfs.com/).' %}</p>
