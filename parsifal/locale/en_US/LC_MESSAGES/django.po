"<strong>Identification of the need for a review.</strong> The need for a "
"systematic review originates from a researcher aiming to understand the "
"state-of-the-art in an area, or from practitioners wanting to use empirical "
"evidence in their strategic decision-making or improvement activities. If "
"there are more or less systematic literature reviews available in the field, "
